# HDFcompress

What are we doing here?
- We are archiving the data to hdf5 format.
- We want to be able to archive data with all kinds of metadata, e.g. figures, paper, etc.
- We also want to be able to be able to easily run some analysis because we know where the data is and the metadata describing it.

First.
- Can we bring multiple studies into a common format?
- We need two studies that are kind of familiar to make this easier to start.
